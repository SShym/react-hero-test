## Description

Responsive React application where you can see a list of heroes on the main page, go to a specific hero's page, delete, edit or add a new hero, in the menu you can change its specific text fields and pictures, pictures are used and stored in the simplest form, as a base64 string, the application is made without any additional libraries like cloudinary to simplify it, rely on functionality and readability of the code, as a UI I used tailwind, on the server side I used express.js;

<p>
  the application has been optimized, unnecessary renderings of components have been removed
</p>

### client: npm install -> npm start
### server: npm install -> nodemon
